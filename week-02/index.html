      <p>I'm an innovative technology leader with 15+ years of experience transforming complex systems into
        scalable, high-impact solutions. Currently serving as Senior Director of Customer Success at Automattic, I lead
        teams
        of 50+ professionals while spearheading major initiatives and global account expansion. As Security Release
        Lead and core committer for WordPress, I direct critical security processes for one of the world's most popular
        content management systems.
      </p>

      <p>My journey spans from teaching graphic design and web development at Stevens-Henager College to engineering
        high-traffic digital properties at WIRED and O'Reilly Media. I've architected integrations featured at Apple
        WWDC, created plugins showcased at Facebook F8, and authored "Bootstrap: Responsive Web Development" for
        O'Reilly Media. With a Master's in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology from USC, I now share my
        passion
        for web technologies as Adjunct Faculty, mentoring the next generation of developers.</p>

      <p>When I'm not leading enterprise transformations or contributing to open source projects, you can find me
        coaching youth baseball and softball, exploring emerging web technologies, or building tools that make the
        web
        more accessible for everyone.</p>
