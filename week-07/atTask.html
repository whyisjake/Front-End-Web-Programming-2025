<!--

This is the test that I got from atTask back in 2010.
Here was the design brief:

I have attached the Mocks and an HTML template file to get you started on this exercise.
Please send email me your completed work on Monday.
So the behaviors should be that when the "plus" button on the right is clicked the "Add Task"
area should animate down and the form should quickly fade in. Clicking on the "plus" again or
clicking "Cancel" should reverse the animation back to the original state. I strongly recommend
using jQuery for the animation. Finally clicking on the "Work Requests" tab should show the
list of work requests in Mock 3. You should be able to switch between the two tabs while remaining
on the same HTML page.

You can find the comps in the /comps folder.
